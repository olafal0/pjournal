# pjournal

Have you ever wanted to self-host a web application just to replace something you could do with a notebook and a pencil? So have I.

pjournal is a web app for keeping a personal journalâ€”like a blog that only you can see. It supports multiple users, full GitHub-flavored markdown, editing, and client-side encryption. Set a local encryption password, and all new or updated posts from that point forward will be encrypted before they're sent to the server!

pjournal is made using [dispatch](https://github.com/flick-web/dispatch), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), and [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org).
