# pjournal

Have you ever wanted to self-host a web application just to replace something you could do with a notebook and a pencil? So have I.

pjournal is a web app for keeping a personal journalâ€”like a blog that only you can see. It's very basic, but it does have multi-user support and full GitHub-flavored markdown support.
